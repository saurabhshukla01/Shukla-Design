        ===============================================
        <p>
        A student or pupil is a learner or someone who attends an educational institution. In Britain, those attending <br>
        university are termed "students". In the United States, and more recently also in Britain, the term "student" <br>
        is applied to both categories: school and university students. In its widest use, student is used for anyone who<br>
        is learning, including mid-career adults who are taking vocational education or returning to university. When speaking <br>
        about learning outside an institution, "student" is also used to refer to someone who is learning a topic or who is <br>
        "a student of" a certain topic or person. In the widest sense of the word, a student is anyone seeking to learn or to <br>
            grow by experience, such as a student of the School of Hard Knocks.</p>
        <p>A mature, non-traditional, or adult student in tertiary education (at a university or a college) is normally <br>
            classified as an (undergraduate) student who is at least 21â€“23 years old at the start of their course and usually<br>
            having been out of the education system for at least two years. Mature students can also include students who have<br>
            been out of the education system for decades, or students with no secondary education. Mature students also make up
            graduate and postgraduate populations by demographic of age.</p>
